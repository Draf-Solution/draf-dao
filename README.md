# draf-dao

In the context of decentralized ecosystems, one may find the overwhelming amount of projects hard to manage. While the pricing maybe able to reflect in coinmarketcap or coingecko0 easily, it fails to have the function of active notification. Also, a lot of coins may not be supported by these centralized organisation. In the spirit of decentralization, shouldn't we have a DAO to decide which projects can be tracked?

As such, it is decided to create a DAO in which participants can vote to have a particular asset to be supported for price tracking. 

As of 20 Nov 2021, a name for this DAO have yet to be decided. As such, we will call it DrafDao for now.
